# Samples Directory

This directory is intentionally left empty.

It exists as part of the project architecture, but sample files are **not committed** at this stage in order to:

- keep the repository clean and lightweight  
- avoid noise in early commits  
- prevent unnecessary storage of temporary or personal data  
- prepare the structure for future OCR testing, benchmarking, and regression datasets  

As development progresses, this folder will host:

- `raw/` sample images  
- `curated/` structured benchmark sets  
- `expected/` ground-truth JSON for regression tests  

For now, the folder remains empty by design.
